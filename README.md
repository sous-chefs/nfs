# NFS [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/atomic-penguin/cookbook-nfs.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/atomic-penguin/cookbook-nfs)

## Description

Installs and configures NFS client, or server components 

## Requirements

Should work on any Red Hat-family or Debian-family Linux distribution.

*Note*:This cookbook depends on Sean O'Meara's [line cookbook](https://github.com/someara/line-cookbook)

## Attributes

* nfs['packages']
  - Makes a best effort to choose NFS client packages dependent on platform
  - NFS server package needs to be hardcoded for Debian/Ubuntu in the server
    recipe, or overridden in a role.

* nfs['service']
  - portmap - the portmap or rpcbind service depending on platform
  - lock - the statd or nfslock service depending on platform
  - server - the server component, nfs or nfs-kernel-server depending on platform

* nfs['config']
  - client\_templates - templates to iterate through on client systems, chosen by platform
  - server\_template - server specific template, chosen by platform

* nfs['port']
  - ['statd'] = Listen port for statd, default 32765
  - ['statd\_out'] = Outgoing port for statd, default 32766
  - ['mountd'] = Listen port for mountd, default 32767
  - ['lockd'] = Listen port for lockd, default 32768

* ~nfs['exports']~
  - Deprecated option.  No longer supported with the exports
    functionality being refactored into an LWRP.

## Usage

To install the NFS components for a client system, simply add nfs to the run\_list.

    name "base"
    description "Role applied to all systems"
    run_list [ "nfs" ]

Then in an nfs\_server.rb role that is applied to NFS servers:

    name "nfs_server"
    description "Role applied to the system that should be an NFS server."
    override_attributes(
      "nfs" => {
        "packages" => [ "portmap", "nfs-common", "nfs-kernel-server" ],
        "port" => {
          "statd" => 32765,
          "statd_out" => 32766,
          "mountd" => 32767,
          "lockd" => 32768
        },
        "exports" => [
          "/exports 10.0.0.0/8(ro,sync,no_root_squash)"
        ]
      }
    )
    run_list [ "nfs::server" ]

### nfs\_export LWRP Usage

Applications or other cookbooks can use the nfs\_export LWRP to add exports:

    nfs_export "/exports" do
      network '10.0.0.0/8'
      writeable false 
      sync true
      options ['no_root_squash']
    end

The default parameters for the nfs\_export LWRP are as follows

* directory 
  - directory you wish to export
  - defaults to resource name

* network
  - a CIDR, IP address, or wildcard (\*)
  - requires an option

* writeable
  - ro/rw export option
  - defaults to false

* sync
  - synchronous/asynchronous export option
  - defaults to true

* options
  - additional export options as an array, excluding the parameterized sync/async and ro/rw options
  - defaults to root\_squash

## nfs::undo recipe

Does your freshly kickstarted/preseeded system come with NFS, when you didn't ask for NFS?  This recipe inspired by the annoyances cookbook, will run once to remove NFS from the system.  Use a knife command to remove NFS components from your system like so.

    knife run_list add <node name> nfs::undo
